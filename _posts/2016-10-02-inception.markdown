I've been thinking about how ideas take root in your head and one day, seemingly unprompted, it feels like the most natural thing in the world to act on them. Like Leonardo D. may have planted the idea in your head as you slept and, voila, the next day you just had to do something about it. Well that's kind of how I discovered I had a burning desire to learn coding. 

It didn't happen when I dated a software programmer for two years in college (that would have been so convenient!) It happened several years later when I decided we weren't that good friends after all when he declined the invitation to my wedding hah! Anyway, this is definitely not a blog post about my romantic (mis)steps. This is about how something that has been in the periphery of my life for as long as I can remember, suddenly became very central.

I have loads of ideas of what I can do with this skill. From marrying my coding knowledge with my years in microfinance to create a microfinance platform for the unbanked (I know it's been done before, but I have a few thoughts on how to improve upon the idea), to creating the new Facebook, to doing something less entrepreneurial but just as rewarding. It really feels like I'm working towards aquiring a superpower: the power to create!

So there it is.. the reason I decided to learn coding. Wish me luck!
